# Binaries
Latest Windows binaries can currently be found on the [releases](https://github.com/LLeny/VkHandybug/releases) page.

# Usage
## First run
You will first need to set the Lynx ROM image path, please use the ```MAIN -> Settings...``` menu to do so.

## Breakpoint condition
The breakpoint condition uses [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), please refer to [Lua's documentation](https://www.lua.org/docs.html) for more information on the syntax.
You can access the Lynx memory by using the different accessors ```RAM, ROM, MIKEY, SUZY, CPU, CART, EEPROM``` by simply using them as arrays, for example ```RAM[0x0012], MIKEY[0xFD02]```.
You can also access the CPU state by using the ```REGS``` accessor, it has the following properties: ```A, X, Y, PC, PS, SP```, for example ```REGS.X```. 

The condition can be edited by simply clicking on the condition cell of the corresponding breakpoint.
```
RAM[0x50FD] > 12 and REGS.X ~= 0
```

## Symbols
To load symbols create a file with the same name as the cart but with the .lbl extension.
The *lbl* file can be a Vice label file (generated by [cl65](https://cc65.github.io/doc/cl65.html) -Ln option) or simply be a list of "addr label".
